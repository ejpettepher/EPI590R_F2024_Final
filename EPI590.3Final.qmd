abstract: "This document utilizes data that was uploaded to Github by Peter Higgins on 06/24/2021. Higgins adapted the data from a study published in the British Medical Journal titled 'Streptomycin Treatment of Pulmonary Tuberculosis' on October 30, 1948 by the Streptomycin in Tuberculosis Trials Committee (pp.769-782).The data was collected from a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of Teburculosis patients across several hospitals in London, England in September, 1946 who received either Streptomycin (2.00g dose) or a placebo and followed for 6 months to observe if there were any improvements in outcomes related to Tb (N= 107). A Table 1, Logistical Regression Model, and Figure were created utilizing functions such as {gtsummary}, {broom}, and {ggplot2}. Those figures and accompanying elements of the EPI590.3 Final are outlined."
